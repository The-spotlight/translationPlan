# Full-Stack Mock Plan

**Hello Everyone,**

We are at the halfway juncture of our journey of becoming a full-stack developer now. And there is one big realization that every person from previous batch have learned is (taken from one of mentor’s Quote):

> **“The faster you fail, the better it is. So, it’s good to fail early”**

That simply means give as many mocks as possible during the course else it will just delay your placement journey. To validate the above, you must have felt yourself evolving through mocks while learning DSA. And I feel very proud to announce that **May Batch has broken all previous records in terms of mock results in DSA within initial 3 months**.

The momentum in giving mocks is awesome and we have a lot more in store as we are approaching towards the second half and more importantly **“The Placements”**.

Presenting to you a roadmap of mocks before placements begin. Here’s what to expect, we have total of 5 Levels in Mock:
*Definition → “Qualify” -> Get a YES or Get a MAYBE with 7 or more rating points.*

> Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4 → Level 5

> `**Level 1**`
> **Syllabus**: Web Dev Mock Beginner (Syllabus: **HTML, CSS, JS Basics**)
> **Start Date**: 10th Sept
> **End Date**: 20th Sept (Can be extended for a few days for Advance DSA students)
> **Criteria**: Complete 75% of front-end assignments
> **Tokens**: Ask your respective mentors for unlocking tokens.
>
> `**Level 2**`
> **Syllabus**: Web Dev Mock Hard (Syllabus: **HTML + CSS, JS Advanced**)
> **End Date:** 30thSeptember

## **What happens to DSA mocks:**

- *Only* ***DSA1\*** *mocks will be kept open for people who are yet to get a* ***YES in DSA1\***
- ***DSA4\*** *a will be kept open for only Advance DSA group students.*

Rest of DSA mocks will starts only near the placement
***Note:\*** *Keep give 10–15% time DSA
****Extra tip:\*** *Start Solve DSA questions in JS as a programming Language*

With this in mind, keep hustling to give and produce the Best. Momentum is always THE KEY.

Happy Coding !!
